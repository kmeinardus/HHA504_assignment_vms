# GCP 
## 1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine
### Access the Google Cloud Console and create a new VM instance using Compute Engine.
- I chose the region closes to NY which was us-east4(Northern Virginia)
- The low cost option I chose was E2

### Select a basic configuration (e.g., Debian GNU/Linux, e2-micro instance type).

### Start the VM and let it run for a few minutes.

## 2. Monitor VM Costs
### In the GCP Console, go to the Billing section and identify the cost incurred by your VM during its runtime.

- I will update this tomorrow. Other classmates say it takes 24 hours to show costs incurred. However, this is where I would go to check costs.
